# tello-edu

A library for controlling and interacting with the [Tello EDU](https://www.ryzerobotics.com/tello-edu) drone using asynchronous Rust and [Tokio]](https://tokio.rs).  All operations are implemented as awaitable futures, completed when the drone sends acknowledgment of the command message.

```Rust
use tello_edu::{Tello, Result};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    fly().await.unwrap();
}

async fn fly() -> Result<()> {
    // create a new drone in the `NoWifi` state 
    let drone = Tello::new();

    // wait until the host computer joins the drone's Wifi network
    // (joining the network is not automatic - how it happens is up to you)
    let drone = drone.wait_for_wifi().await?;

    // establish connection and put the drone in "command" mode
    let drone = drone.connect().await?;

    // fly!
    drone.take_off().await?;
    drone.turn_clockwise(360).await?;
    drone.land().await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

(If Python is your thing, there is also an equivalent Python package - [tello-asyncio](https://pypi.org/project/tello-asyncio/).)
